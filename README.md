# bussiness_contract_validation
Business contracts are legal documents. The first task is to parse these documents so that have a 
structure to them. Determine the key details within the contract document. Every contract has clauses 
and sub-clauses. The next step is to classify the contents of the parsed documents to these clauses. 
Typically, a contract has an associated template to it, and it is important to determine the deviations 
from that template and highlight them.
